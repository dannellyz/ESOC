EMC10272,EASTMINCOM ,REGION 12,SARANGANI PROV ,ENCOUNTER,10ID ,10ID3-TOC-1010-428-12 ,10 Oct 2012,"Progress Report from Journal Nr. EMC10237 dtd 10/10/2012On 080600 Oct 2012, Progress report Regarding the Tuanadatu Situation. ",,,,,,,"ASSESSMENT:   1. The bandits are crisscrossing provincial boundary of Sarangani Province and Sultan Kudarat to evade government troops.  As soon as troops leave the area, the bandits could easily strike back on the vulnerable Tboli tribe targeting not only those in Tuanadatu but including those in nearby Brgys Upo and Ticulab where their relatives are.  Therefore, chances of this incident recurring time and again remain high unless ongoing effort to neutralize its leaders and members succeeds.  2. Why this bandit group will always go back to Tuanadatu?  This bandit group has thrived on extortion, drug trade and illegal logging for years.  Its main sources of income thru extortion come from businessmen and big landowners in Maitum.  They won’t survive in Brgy Molon, Palimbang.  Molon is a ghost brgy with only less than ten (10) abandoned houses.   There is no food in Brgy Molon.   Likewise, on drugs, it can be recalled that on two occasions in the past, 73IB conducted raid and successfully uprooted marijuana plantations at the bandits’ lair in Sitios Balagon and Sitios Kadapukan, Tuanadatu.  The 73IB has also recently confiscated 6,000 bd ft of logs coming from Tuanadatu.  On economic prospects, the bandits have also speculated on the big ticket investments  (SMC in particular) coming into the Tuanadatu, Maitum-Ned, Lake Sebu corridor that if they could gain control of Tuanadatu, they would have leverage on the benefits and other windfalls derived from those projects.  3. This group may have also served as mercenary, having been used by some unscrupulous politicians of Palimbang and Maitum to liquidate political opponents and for money-making activities. It can be recalled that this is the same group responsible for kidnapping a Korean national Jae Keo Yoon and a Gensan businessman Mr. Carlos Bilonio on 06 Feb 2002.   Historically also, Maitum have had three of its past Mayors (Mayor Yabes, Reganet and Caabucayan) murdered and whose cases remain unresolved to this date.  4. MILF’S POSITION ON THE ISSUE.  Thru continuing consultations and coordination with the help of LGU-Maitum and Palimbang and other informal channels, the MILF units in the area have remained fully supportive of this campaign to hunt down the bandits and bring them to justice for what they did to the Tboli tribe.   5. Therefore, it is to the best interest of the national government, PLGU-Sarangani, LGUs Maitum and Palimbang, the people of Maitum, the peace-loving Tboli tribe and Muslim population of both municipalities and even to the MILF  that this lawless armed group be eradicated to restore peace and order in the  Tboli home land (Tuanadatu and its neighboring brgys).    RECOMMENDATION: That representation be made to higher headquarters for the EMC to direct the Marines now deployed at Kalibuhan to also conduct complementary operations to hunt down these bandits particularly targeting Sitios Nabagtugan, Kalibuhan(NXG 575985), Brgy Molon and nearby areas (all Palimbang-side). Recommended areas for clearing operations  by the marines are VGL 53-65, HGL 90-92 vic Nabagtugan and VGL 53-55 HGL 94- 95 vic Puting Bato, all of Kalibuhan, Palimbang, SK. The Marines in Kalibuhan had been observed to be passive in terms of running after the bandits. Their presence in Kalibuhan is sort of peacekeeping only. The 1002nd Bde’s ongoing effort against the bandits, if properly complemented from the marines-side will quickly bring this crisis to a successful conclusion; otherwise this problem keeps on recurring thus draining on our resources. Lateral coordination with the Marines had been made and they said that they will take no action unless directed by HHqs.   ",
