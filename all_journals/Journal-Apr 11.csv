The perpetrators also divested the farm workers of their cell phones and money estimated to be Php 25,000.00./b. The burning is closely related to a land dipute in the area. The poultry house is located in 120 hectares of land owned by Mr Olivan. The land was confiscated by the NPA in the early 80s and awarded same to benificiaries of the agrarian revolution. The beneficiaries occupied the land until 2007. In the early 2008, Mr Olivan regained ownership of the land after a CAA detachment was established in the area. Mr Olivan evicted the settlers and installed his own caretakers and refused to yield to the demands of the NPA. Furthermore, workers at the poultry house also came from other province. The move gained the ire of the agreed beneficiaries who were mostly residents of Brgy Dinumpilan. Efforts to settle the problem yielded negative results./c. The hostility is specifically directed at the burning of the poultry house.
